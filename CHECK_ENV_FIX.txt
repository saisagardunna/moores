# 🔧 Fix Environment Variable Issue

## ✅ Steps to Fix:

1. **STOP THE SERVER** (Important!)
   - Click in the terminal
   - Press `Ctrl + C`
   - Wait for it to stop

2. **START THE SERVER**
   - Run: `npm run dev`
   - Wait for "Ready in..."

3. **TEST IT**
   - Go to browser: http://localhost:3000 (or 3001)
   - Hard Refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Submit the order

4. **CHECK TERMINAL output**
   - Look for lines like:
     ```
     DEBUG: API Key length: 36
     DEBUG: API Key start: d94c3
     ```

## ❓ What to look for:
- If Length is **0** or **undefined**: The `.env.local` file is still not being read (Restart server again!).
- If Length is **36**: API Key is loaded correctly!

## 📧 If it says "Email sent: false":
- Copy the **entire terminal output** and share it with me.
- It will tell us exactly why Web3Forms rejected it (e.g., Access Key invalid, rate limit, etc.)
