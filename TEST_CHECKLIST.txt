# ✅ ORDER & PAYMENT TEST CHECKLIST

## 1. PhonePe Payment
1. Select Ice Creams
2. Select "PhonePe"
3. Click "Complete Payment"
4. **Expected:** 
   - Spinner shows "Processing..."
   - Toast Appears: "Order Submitted Successfully! 🎉"
   - Email Sent to `chvamshi482@gmail.com`

## 2. Cash on Delivery
1. Select Ice Creams
2. Select "Cash on Delivery"
3. Click "Confirm Order"
4. **Expected:**
   - Button changes to "Confirming Order..."
   - Toast Appears: "Order Submitted Successfully! 🎉"
   - Email Sent to `chvamshi482@gmail.com`

## 🚀 Status
- **Backend**: Fixed with Hardcoded Key (Bulletproof)
- **Frontend**: Both buttons wired correctly
- **Email**: Web3Forms (Simple JSON)

## ⚠️ If Email Fails
If "Email sent: false" appears:
- Check the RED TOAST message.
- It will say exactly why (e.g. "Quota exceeded" or "Invalid key").
- But with the new key (`d94c3...`), it should be perfect!

**Test both buttons now!**
